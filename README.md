## Overview
Reconnect is an application designed to streamline the process of obtaining referrals. The platform caters to two types of users: Referents and Referrers.

Referents are individuals seeking referrals. They can browse profiles on the platform and send referral requests to potential Referrers.
Referrers are individuals who provide referrals. Upon receiving a request, a Referrer can review the Referent's profile to assess suitability. If the Referrer is satisfied, they can accept the request, enabling both parties to communicate further and exchange information through the integrated chat system.
Reconnect simplifies the referral process, making it easier for users to connect and collaborate based on mutual interests and needs.

## Docker Configuration for Backend Application

#### Spring Boot Application Deployment

Use a base image like Ubuntu or Alpine:
* `FROM ubuntu:latest`

Install Java:
* `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jdk`

Install Nginx:
* `RUN apt-get install -y nginx`

Copy your Nginx configuration files and Java applications:
* `COPY frontend/Re-Connect/dist/re-connect /usr/share/nginx/html`
* `COPY backend/target/reconnect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar reconnect.jar`

Expose ports for Nginx and your Java application:
* `EXPOSE 80`
* `EXPOSE 8080`

#### Start Nginx and your Java application
* `CMD service nginx start && java -jar /reconnect.jar`

To build and run the container:

* `docker build -t reconnect .`

* `docker run -p 8080:8080 reconnect`

----------
## Docker Configuration for  Frontend Application

#### Node.js Application Deployment

Use an official Nginx image as the base image:
* `FROM nginx:latest`

Set the working directory inside the container:
* `WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html`

Remove default Nginx static assets:
* `RUN rm -rf ./*`

Copy the built Angular application files into the container:
* `COPY dist/re-connect .`

Expose port 80 to allow external access:
* `EXPOSE 80`

#### Start Nginx when the container starts
* `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`

# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

This `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines a GitLab CI/CD pipeline with four stages: build, test, push, and deploy.

### Build Stage

#### build_frontend
- **Image Used:** `node:20`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Change directory to `./frontend/Re-Connect`.
  - Install npm dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --prefer-offline`.
  - Run either `npm run build:production` for the main branch or `npm run build:development` for other branches.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on merge requests and branches, triggered by changes in the frontend directory or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

#### build_backend
- **Image Used:** `maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Change directory to `./backend`.
  - Clean and package the backend application with `mvn clean package -DskipTests=true`.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on merge requests and branches, triggered by changes in the backend directory or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Test Stage

#### test_backend
- **Image Used:** `maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Change directory to `./backend`.
  - Run the unit tests with `mvn test`.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on merge requests and branches, triggered by changes in the backend directory or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Push Stage

#### push_frontend
- **Image Used:** `docker:20`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Change directory to `./frontend/Re-Connect`.
  - Build and push the frontend Docker image.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the main and dev branches, triggered by changes in the frontend directory or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

#### push_backend
- **Image Used:** `docker:20`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Change directory to `./backend`.
  - Build and push the backend Docker image.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the main and dev branches, triggered by changes in the backend directory or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Deploy Stage

#### deploy_local_frontend
- **Image Used:** `docker:20`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Deploy the frontend Docker image to a local Docker environment.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the dev branch with the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` variable set to "dev".

#### deploy_local_backend
- **Image Used:** `docker:20`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Deploy the backend Docker image to a local Docker environment.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the dev branch with the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` variable set to "dev".

#### deploy_prod_frontend
- **Image Used:** `alpine:latest`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Deploy the frontend Docker image to a VM environment.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the main branch.

#### deploy_prod_backend
- **Image Used:** `alpine:latest`
- **Script Actions:**
  - Deploy the backend Docker image to a VM environment.
- **Execution Condition:** Runs on the main branch with the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` variable set to "prod".

This pipeline ensures that the code is built, tested, pushed to a Docker registry, and then deployed to the appropriate environments in an automated manner.

---------------------
## Usage Scenarios

### 1. **Referent User Flow**

#### Registration and Login
- **Register as a Referent**: Users can sign up as referents by providing the required registration information.
- **Login**: After registration, referents can log in to the application using their credentials.

#### Landing Page
- **User Profile**: Upon logging in, referents are directed to the landing page, where they can see their username on the right side. They can click on the username to edit their profile information, except for the username itself. Editable fields include:
  - Skills
  - Company (as users may change companies over time)

- **Search**: Referents can search for referrers by their name or company name.

#### Sending Requests
- **Request Sending**: Referents can send requests to referrers. If a referrer accepts the request, the interaction will appear in the messaging section of the application, allowing both parties to communicate.

#### Request Management
- **Request Options**: On the left side of the screen, referents can access the requests section, which shows pending requests and notifications for accepted requests.

### 2. **Referrer User Flow**

#### Registration and Login
- **Register as a Referrer**: Users can sign up as referrers by providing the required registration information.
- **Login**: After registration, referrers can log in to the application using their credentials.

#### Landing Page
- **User Profile**: Upon logging in, referrers are directed to the landing page, where they have the same options as referents to search for users by name or company.

#### Request Management
- **Request Handling**: Referrers can view the number of pending requests and choose to accept them. Once a request is accepted, it will be reflected in both the referrer and referent's messaging pages, enabling communication.

### Dashboard Page
- **Overview**: The dashboard provides an overview of the application's user base and other statistics, including:
  - **Users by Country**: A graph showing the distribution of users from different countries.
  - **Users by Type**: A pie chart displaying the proportion of referents and referrers.
  - **Top 5 Companies**: A list showing the top 5 companies with the most users.

- **Admin Options**: The dashboard also includes options for administrators to add or modify countries, companies, and skills.
